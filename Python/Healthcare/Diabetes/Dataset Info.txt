About the Dataset
This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The primary goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements provided in the dataset. The instances in this dataset were selected from a larger database, with particular constraints applied. Notably, all patients included are females aged 21 years or older and of Pima Indian heritage.  

The dataset, available in a `.csv` file, contains several attributes. Most of these are independent variables (medical predictor variables), while one is a dependent target variable (`Outcome`).
